RESTful Routes is a standized way of naming routes
a mapping between HTTP routes and CRUD
CREATE READ UPDATE DESTROY

Index       /cats           GET     lists all cats

New         /cats/new       GET     shows new cat form
Create      /cats           POST    creates new cate, redirects elsewhere

Show        /cats/:id       GET     shows info about one cat

Edit        /cats/:id/edit  GET     shows edit form for cat
Update      /cat/:id        PUT     update a particular cat, redirects elsewhere

for the update route, it is handled as a PUT request however html cant do PUT requests. 
the work around to this is to set it as a POST request and use method overide to override 
it into a PUT request. this is done by adding ?_method=PUT at the end of the link and
npm installing method-override

Destroy     /cat/:id        DELETE  deletes a particular cat, redirects elsewhere


npm install express-sanitizer in order to stop people from running javascript in through
the html
